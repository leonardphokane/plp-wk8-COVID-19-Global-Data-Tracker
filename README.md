# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-Project
# 🌍 COVID-19 Data Analysis in Eastern Africa

This project analyzes the COVID-19 pandemic data in Eastern African countries using the OWID (Our World In Data) dataset. It explores trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations, and presents visual insights to better understand the regional impact of the pandemic.

📊 Insights & Reflections
Kenya and Ethiopia reported the highest total COVID-19 cases among Eastern African nations.

Rwanda leads in vaccination efforts, with the highest percentage of vaccinated population in the region.

Burundi and South Sudan have sparse or inconsistent data, possibly due to limited testing/reporting.

Daily new case trends align with global waves but show regional differences in timing and magnitude.

Interactive visualizations and choropleth maps greatly improve the understanding of data patterns.
